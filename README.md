I have created two dockerfiles one for frontend and backend

I did npm ci and npm start for both front end and backend, it was good with the backend but with the frontend i had to clean the code with by running run npm fund

   run npm audit fix

   run npm audit fix --force 

   run npm audit 
   
   and i could see the end product
   
It could connect onmy local but not on ecs 

The front-end and back-end image is in the terraform code i build
